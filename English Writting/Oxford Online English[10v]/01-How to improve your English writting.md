# 1 Understand your readers and what they want
> **Questings**:
> + Who you are writting for?
> + What are you trying to achieve?
> + Waht does your reader want?

# 2 Plan your writting

> **Questings**:
> + What ideas are you going to include?
> + What ideas are you going to leave out?
> + How are you going to organise your ideas? 

因此，我们需要思考：
+ Think about your goal.
+ Think about your readers' needs

# 3 Organise your ideas into paragraphs

> **Use paragraphs**:
> + One main idea per paragraph.
> + Do not try to do too much in one paragraph.
> + There is no minimum length for a paragraph. 

# 4 Cut empy words and sentences

**Write as little as possible**:

> very tired $\rightarrow$ exhausted</br>


> absolutely exhausted $\rightarrow$ exhausted</br>


> This will get better in the future. $\rightarrow$ This will improve in the future. 

> Maybe this will solve the problem. $\rightarrow$ This will solve the problem. 

> She gave me a lot of help. $\rightarrow$ She helped me a lot.  

# 5 Use shorter, simpler sentences where possible

> **Notes**:
> + 10 words is a good target. 
> + 20+ words could be dangerous. 

> **Suggestings**:
> + Do not use passive voice unless you need to. 
> + Put your subject at the start of the sentence. 
> + Do not use relative clauses unless you really need to. 
>   + 尽量不使用关系从句，将句子边长。
> + Consider breaking longer sentences into shorter ones. 
>   + 这一句主要是说当使用And， but， or等连接词时，考虑将长句拆短。
